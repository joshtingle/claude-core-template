# Schema Contract (warehouse-analytics)

The contract between the warehouse mart layer and the application.  Every mart that the app reads is documented here.

Update this file whenever a mart is added, modified, or deprecated.  Treat it as you would API documentation: changes are versioned and breaking changes are flagged.

## Mart catalog

For each mart, document:

### `mart_name`

Purpose: One sentence describing what business question(s) this mart answers.

Grain: One row per what?  (account-month, opportunity, account-product-month, etc.)

Refresh cadence: How often does this mart get rebuilt?  (e.g. every 4 hours via `snapshot.yml`)

Source dependencies: Which staging or raw tables does this mart depend on?  (See `LINEAGE.md` for full path.)

Validation reference: Pointer to the validation query and the known-good number it should return.

Columns:

| Column | Type | Description | Nullable | Notes |
|--------|------|-------------|----------|-------|
| (column) | (type) | (what it means) | (Y/N) | (caveats) |

Sample row:

(Include 1-2 sample rows formatted as a code block so consumers can see the shape concretely.)

Known caveats: Anything weird about this mart that consumers need to know.  Special filters applied?  Certain account types excluded?  Forecast periods handled differently from actuals?

---

(Repeat the block above for each mart)
